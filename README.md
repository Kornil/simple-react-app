# simple-react-app
Simple base app with react, react-router v4, hot-reload &amp; sass.

## What is this
This is a base project that you can use to jumpstart your react apps.
It includes the last react spec as of today 22/05/2017, and uses react-router v4 to handle routes.
Style is handles by sass/scss.
nb: this is just front end, you can use whatever backend language you are most confortable with.

## How to install
You need yarn, it's a better version of npm, works the same, faster and easier, all the big guys are using it.
[Just follow the guide to install yarn on your machine](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)


`yarn install` to install all the dependencies.


`yarn start` to start dev server with hot reload, it's live on `localhost:3000`.


`yarn build` to build prod bundle, it includes both treeshaking and uglify to optimize the code as much as possible.

## Eslint

This project uses AirBnB Javascript specs so you can write error-free react and javasctipt code, if you use Visual Studio Code, you can install eslint from the extension tab to activate this function, other editors just google _name of the editor + eslint_ you will find how to enable it for your editor.
